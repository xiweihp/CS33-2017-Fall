The echo_cnt is thread-safe. Because it use semaphores to protect the shared variables,
using P(&mutex) and V(&mutex) to protect the global variable byte_cnt.
It is not reentrant. According to the definition, a reentrant should not reference any
shared data. However, echo_cnt uses static int byte_cnt.
