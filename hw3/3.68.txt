A = 9; B = 5

From first instruction, we know int t has offset 8. Because of the alignment restrictions, so the possible value of B*1 is 5-8. Silimalry, we can found the possible value for A is 7-10. And from the final assembly code we know that the offset of long y is 184, and because it must be multiply of 8, we know A*B should be either 45 or 46. 
So:
A: 7~10
B: 5~8
A*B : 45~46

Then only A = 9 and B = 5 would work.
